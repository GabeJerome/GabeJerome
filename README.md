Hi, Iâ€™m @GabeJerome. I am a junior computer science major at South Dakota School of Mines and Technology. I am currently interning at NASA! I work in flight software 
for exercise machines on missions to space. This means I have been busier than usual, so my github activity has slowed. I am passionate about computers and determined 
to change lives with my knowledge of them. Thank you for stopping by my page. I am happy to speak with anybody that is willing to talk, so I have listed my contact info 
below.
