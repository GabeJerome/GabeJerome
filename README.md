Hi, Iâ€™m @GabeJerome. I am a sophomore computer science major at South Dakota School of Mines and Technology. I'm interested in visual and interactive computations.
As of right now, I have no experience with GUIs. I am currently working with data management on my free time. I am passionate about computers and determined to change
lives with my knowledge of them. Thank you for stopping by my page. I am happy to speak with anybody that is willing to talk, so I have listed my contact info below.
